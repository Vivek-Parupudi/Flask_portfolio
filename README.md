# Flask_portfolio

This is a personal portfolio website I'm trying to create using Flask framework. 
I chose Flask because it doesn't come with any boilerplate code and it's easy to build an app in Flask.

main.py python file consists of the Python code to run the app and redirects to different pages on the website

Since, Flask reads HTML files from 'templates' folder, I added all my HTML files to it.

The static folder consists of CSS and JavaScript files which I'm planning to add in future.
